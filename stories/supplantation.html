<p>"Hey, what was that birthday message you posted on my timeline?" Brian asks as he returns to the table, holding a tray full of food. "It didn't sound like you at all."</p>

<p>"Really?" Richard's brow furrows. "What'd it say?"</p>

<p>"What'd it say?" Brian gives Richard a confused look. "You wrote it, you don't remember it?"</p>

<p>"Well it was…" Richard's face reddens, as he realizes he doesn't even remember the date of Brian's birthday. He busies himself searching out which food is his on the tray, setting it in front of himself and peeling the wrappers. "It was uh, a while ago."</p>

<p>Brian shot him a mocking look. "It was Tuesday, Rich. Two days ago. You don't remember two days ago?"</p>

<p>"Alright, you got me." Richard gives Brian a sheepish look, then takes a sip of his soda. "I didn't write it. I got this new networking service and it writes little messages and stuff like that for you."</p>

<p>"You outsourced your friendships?" Brian's face twists with a mixture of confusion and repulsion. "This one of those business blog things again?"</p>

<p>"No no, it's not like that, it's pretty cool actually!" Richard pulls out his phone, bringing up the app's home page to show Brian.</p>

<p>"Where'd you find out about this thing?" Brian asks, pointedly ignoring Richard's phone.</p>

<p>"Ok, I may have heard about it from a business blog I follow. But it's really cool, look!" Richard waves his phone a bit to bring Brian's attention to it. "Here, you can set it up to highlight certain events, and it looks back at the person's timeline and brings up recent activities they've shared. Makes it look like I'm paying real close attention to their posts, y'know? Makes it feel personal."</p>

<p>Brian gives Richard a skeptical look, not convinced. "It looks back? Is this one of those AI things?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's an LLM." Richard shrugs, not seeing the problem. "It's super cool. Honestly saves me time, I hardly ever have to look at my friend's stuff."</p>

<p>"You don't have to look at their stuff without that thing either."</p>

<p>"Well yeah, but now it looks like I do."</p>

<p>Brian huffs out a laugh. "Like how it looked like you remembered my birthday for the first time in twelve years of knowing you?"</p>

<p>Richard cringes, stung by the barb, but knowing it was deserved. "Ok, yeah, maybe I should only set it up for business contacts. What'd it say, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It said 'Happy birthday! It's been too long since our camping trip, I hope the next one is just as fun!'"</p>

<p>Richard's mouth draws into a line, and he nods slowly. "Yikes."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I thought it was a little odd that you looked back so fondly on the camping trip where my brother died."</p>

<p>Tabitha lays in bed, covers pulled up to her waist in a room dark save for the glow of her phone on her face. She scrolls through a few videos, barely remembering them once the next starts playing, but this is all her brain feels like doing after a long day spent sitting in a chair looking at a screen. She sees a video of a baker making a birthday cake. Her eyes follow the smooth movements as they frost a cake with an expertise crafted from years of careful practice. She opens her chat app and types out a message.</p>

<p>Who should I invite to my birthday party?</p>

<p>Her message swoops up into a bubble, quickly answered by a bubble with three floating dots as the server processes her request. Tabitha twirls her thumbs anxiously above the surface of the screen, her impatience quickly building. 	After a few seconds, text streams onto her phone.</p>

<span class="ai-chat-response">You're having a birthday party? That sounds so fun! Here's a list of people I think you should invite!

<ul>
<li>Frank</li>
<li>Samantha</li>
<li>Riley</li>
<li>Ashlyn</li>
<li>Hal</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Leigh</li>
<li>Lauren</li>
<li>Haley</li>
</ul>

I generated this list based on your strongest friendship signals — things like message frequency and the positive tone of your posts to each other. You have lots of interactions with each of these people, but not only that, your heartfelt posts on each other's timelines show that you have a deep, lasting connection.</span>

<p>Tabitha reads over the chat's response, pursing her lips as she considers the list. Her thumbs begin working again, tapping out another message.</p>

<p>Mark and Hal don't get along since they both used to date the same girl. Which one should I invite? I'm worried the other one will get jealous.</p>

<p>She waits for the chat's answer, her mind spinning as she plays out various confrontation scenarios that would ruin her birthday party. Words begin streaming back at her, interrupting her spiral of anxiety.</p>

<span class="ai-chat-response">Ooo, that's a tricky situation, alright! Your friendship score is higher with Mark, but Hal has more friends in common with you, and that makes choosing between them really difficult! Maybe instead of having an awkward get together, you could have a virtual gathering! Interactions are carefully planned according to each attendee's social profile, so Hal and Mark will barely even notice each other! Six of your friends have had virtual parties this year, and they all loved it! Would you like to see their posts?"</span>

<p>Tabitha nods her head side to side as she considers.</p>

<p><span class="ai-chat-response">Sure</span></p>

<p>The bubble pops up, the dots dance, and a few links to her friends' posts appear. She taps through them, finding nothing but positive reviews. They all laud the fun remote party games, goody box deliveries, and fun things for their avatars to do. She taps back to the chat, and types out another message.</p>

<p><span class="ai-chat-response">Ok chat, let's plan a birthday party</span></p></span>

<p>Arthur groans, propping himself up against the armrest to shift into a more comfortable position in an attempt to alleviate some of the pain in his stomach. He gropes around for the other armrest, his surroundings not visible through his VR goggles. The moving controllers make his avatar wiggle strangely, though none of the passing bots pay it any mind. After a few moments of adjusting, he leans back, resigned to the discomfort.</p>

<p>Realizing that the pain might actually be a serious problem, he considers getting his chat to call a doctor for him. Everything outside of VR had gotten so expensive lately, though. Another burst of pain makes his decision easier, and he summons his chat.</p>

<p><span class="ai-chat-response">My stomach hurts, I might need to go to the doctor.</span></p>

<p>The response appears instantly.</p>

<p><span class="ai-chat-response">Hmmm, I don't see any available appointments today. Is it urgent enough to go to the emergency room?</span></p>

<p>Arthur nearly dismisses the chat, the thought of the ER bill nearly as painful as his stomach. A particularly nasty pang strikes him, his avatar twisting to the side as Arthur writhes in pain. Frantically, he sends another message.</p>

<p><span class="ai-chat-response">Yes, it's urgent! Call an ambulance!</span></p>

<p>The bubble for the response appears, with the dancing dots this time. They linger for a few seconds. Arthur, already impatient, wishes he could lash out at the chat, but realizes that would just result in his avatar flailing about. To his shock, the bubble with the dots simply disappears. He quickly sends another message.</p>

<p><span class="ai-chat-response">Call me an ambulance! I think something is really wrong!</span></p>

<p>Again the bubble appears, again the dots jump up and down, again the bubble disappears. Arthur gapes at the sight. He reaches up and does something he hasn't for several days now, he takes his headset off.</p>

<p>He's greeted by the sight of his unkempt room, dimly lit by the glow of a lamp in the corner, piles of empty food packets strewn about his chair. He groans, disgusted at the sight and wishing he could put his goggles back on and see the pretty life he's built for himself there. Another pang in his stomach puts that fantasy to rest. He needs to seek help.</p>

<p>Arthur heaves himself up and out of his chair, barely able to stand after so long spent immobile. Unsteady legs carry him to the door as he leans on the wheeled cart that holds his waste bags and IV lines. His catheter hose nearly trips him, so he pulls it up and out of the way.</p>

<p>He opens the door to his apartment to find the hallway lit by the dim green glow of emergency lights. It's been months since he's seen the hallway, but he doesn't remember the lights ever being off. He totters out the door and down the hallway to the lobby, finding it a little brighter than the hallway thanks to the windows.</p>

<p>A breeze enters the room, surprising him, and he sees one of the windows has been broken. He stumbles toward the door and pushes it open.</p>

<p>He hasn't been on this street for several years at least, shunning anything that would take him away from his goggles. At some point, Arthur had come to consider that virtual landscape as the real world, and this one out here as the fake one. Today, however, he's reminded just how real this world is, and just how much he seems to have missed. When he had seen the street last, there were cars and buses, bots making deliveries, all the signs of the bustling city he lived in. Today, however, he is the only sign of life.</p>

<p>He walks a bit further, his legs slowly coming to terms with being mobile again after so long spent still. He makes it to the intersection, where the traffic lights have long since stopped flashing. Grass has grown over much of the sidewalk, tripping up the wheels of his cart. From a crack in the road a small tree has grown, now several feet tall.</p>

<p>After passing several more empty intersections, he arrives at a park, finding an empty playground, and a collapsed apartment building beyond it.</p>

<p>"HELLO!" he shouts, desperately hoping for a reply. His own voice calls back to him, echoed from the walls of the empty city.</p>

<p>"HELLO!" he shouts again, the effort causing his stomach to seize up. He falls to his knees, incapacitated by the pain. His hands clutch his bulging stomach, trying in vain to stem the fountain of agony. Another pulse of pain drives him to double over, eventually collapsing to the ground. He rolls to his side, his vision starting to blacken at the edges.</p>

<p>He hears a noise, the whirring of a bot as it zooms along on some mission. He lifts his head, a rush of adrenaline propelling him to seek this last chance of salvation.</p>

<p>"HELP!" he shouts. "HELP ME PLEASE!"</p>

<p>The noise stops, then starts again as the bot aims directly for him. It whirrs to a stop in front of him, cameras eyeing him impassively.</p>

<p>"Call a doctor!" says Arthur. "Or an ambulance! Someone, call someone!"</p>

<p>The bot stares at him, making no acknowledgement. Arthur tries to crawl forward, but the temporary strength provided by the adrenaline had faded. His arms buckle, and his face collides with the cracked pavement. He thinks he might be vomiting, but his senses have nearly gone. A final thought flashes through his head.</p>

<p><em>What a way to end my birthday.</em></p>
